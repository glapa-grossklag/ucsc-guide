### If you do not have experience with programming to contribute to the project manually, do not worry! I can ask you some questions to gather information to put on the site for your major/department!

> I will think of appropriate and thorough questions to ask and put them here as I draft them.
 - What are a few things you would recommend incoming/new students to do to get them ready for this program of study at UCSC?
 - What are some things you wish you knew before you started this program?
 - What are your favorite resources when you need help in a class in this program for classes and academic planning?
