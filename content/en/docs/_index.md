Hello! Welcome to UCSC and the Unofficial Student Guide! Congratulations on your admission and enrollment at UC Santa Cruz!

### For New/Prospective Students
This guide serves to introduce new students to UCSC student life through tips and experiences shared from experienced fellow UCSC peers. I find that many UCSC sites are hard to navigate and not incredibly informative since they lack student opinions, so this guide will complement much of the important information from the UCSC sites with student perspectives and thoughts to give new students a more realistic and wholistic introduction to UCSC.

### For Current/Returning Students
Some of the information in The Guide may already be known to you and some of it may not. If you find something wrong/incorrect or would like to add more information, please let me know or see the Contribution Guide if you would like to try making a fix yourself!

### Site Navigation and Use

There is a navigation bar on the left-hand side that will categorize all the different sections of The Guide, ranging from off campus housing to preparation for your major studies to student employment. I will put as many relevant links from UCSC sites as I can throughout The Guide so you can always trace back this summarized information to the source to verify its authenticity.

The right side of each page will have links to the different subsections of that page for easy access to particular information you are looking for or just to act as a summary of what the current page has.

The bottom of each page will have a link to the next section if you want to read and click through in order, but you can pick and choose any section from the navigation bar - order doesn't matter. The time this site was last updated will also be on the bottom of each page, so you know how up-to-date the information is.

I will try to put up as many preparation guide for as many majors as I can but I am a Computer Science major, so my expertise in other fields is not good enough to know how to make an appropriate guide for other programs of study. So I will contact other students and department advising offices to put something together. This will be something along the lines of a "Things I wish I knew before starting \[Your Major\] at UCSC".

There will also be more general UCSC student information in addition to specific majors and programs, such as dining hall, On/off campus housing, residential colleges, and financial aid guides too.
